---

### 🧩 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Smruti-R18/employee-attrition.git
cd employee-attrition
```

### 🧱 2. Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate
```
Once activated, your terminal should show (env) at the start of the line.

### 📦 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
confirm the packages using
```bash
pip list
```
Ensure the correct version of Scikit-learn (1.7.1) is installed for model compatibility.

### 🚀 4. Run the Flask Server

python app.py
```

### 🌐 5. Open in Browser
Go to:
👉 http://localhost:5000
or
👉 http://127.0.0.1:5000

The web application should now be running locally.

💡 To test the application, you can use the sample input files available in the **`test_inputs/`** folder.
